### Bio

![Brian](/images/members/current/brian.jpg)

When Brian is not thinking about sweet Roaring 20 tenor harmonies you
can count on him thinking about kittens—petting them, snuggling them,
nuzzling them. Thus swapping North Carolina for New Jersey has been
difficult because he misses (in increasing order) biscuits, Southern
hospitality and his kitties Pikachu and Harriet.  He tries to deal
with the pain with a kitty calendar from Labyrinth and also
Fluffingtonpost but hurts like these never heal.  Aside from this
arguably creepy cat fetish Brian really likes reading and writing and
swimming and running.  If he could turn into anyone in the world it
would be Beyonce but J K Rowling would be a close second.  Buy him a
chai tea, give him a massage and play him some acoustic and he will
literally do whatever you want.
