### Bio

![Mary Lou](/images/members/current/marylou.jpg)

Despite having a very southern-sounding first name (Mama’s from
Dallas), Mary Lou was born and raised in SoCal, and is a true
California girl at heart. She’s melted like, seven popsicles since she
got to New Jersey. She complains bitterly about any weather that isn’t
windless, cloudless, and above 72 degrees. She likes thrift stores and
consignment shops and is also romantically attracted to shoes. She
says “obvi,” “totes,” and “adorbz.” She’s a diehard show choir alumni
who didn’t want to let the music fade, and so gratefully embraced the
chance to be a part of Roaring 20. Feed her spicy things (Cholula,
Sriracha, Red Rooster, etc.), make her laugh until she slaps her knees
(really, she does that), or sing her a Killers song (which she knows
all the words to) and she just might have to marry you.
