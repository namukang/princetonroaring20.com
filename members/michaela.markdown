### Bio

![Michaela](/images/members/current/michaela.jpg)

Born and raised in the far off land of Toronto, Canada, Michaela spent her childhood riding dog-sleds to school in the below-freezing weather, wearing toques, playing hockey, and drinking straight maple syrup while lounging in her igloo on a bed of ice. Since arriving in New Jersey, she’s been repeatedly afraid of melting when someone says the temperature is 60 degrees, but just doesn’t really have the energy to learn the imperial system. When she’s not embodying the average northerner, Michaela likes to see how many chins she can produce by pushing her face entirely into her neck, look at art, pretend to be someone else on stage, listen to early 2000s RnB, make additions to her ample sock collection, and sing with the Princeton Roaring 20!
