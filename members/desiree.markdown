### Bio

![Desiree](/images/members/current/desiree.jpg)

Desi's origins are unknown. Most scholars postulate that one day, an
Atlantic mermaid was feeling particularly down, so she cried tears of
molten lava and formed an underwater firecracker, which over a period
of 47 years congealed into the shape of a bubbling, beautiful, baby
girl. Historians cannot confirm this at this time. Regardless, Desiree
surfaced next as a freshman at Princeton University, where she joined
the Roaring 20. When not busy dressing herself in shrouds of mystery
or performing for drooling audiences, Desiree enjoys communing with
Calypso and weaving dreams for innocent sleepers in the adjacent rooms
in Forbes College.
