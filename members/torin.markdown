### Bio

![Torin](/images/members/current/torin.jpg)

Torin hails from the verdant suburbs of Eugene, Oregon, and feels
privileged to be able to sing with a group as fine as Roaring 20. At
home, he has a mother and father, two older sisters, and a number of
vagrant types living in his house, all of whom he loves very much. At
Princeton, he hopes to study Public Policy, while fulfilling his
lifelong dream of learning everything. When Torin is not singing, he
enjoys playing the piano, arranging music, coding, and Chinese
literature.
