### Bio

![Viv](/images/members/current/viv.jpg)

Hailing from the glorious land Down Under, Viv spent her childhood
riding kangaroos, catching crocodiles (a la Steve Irwin) and mastering
the art of avoiding the dreaded Drop Bear. She speaks only the native
Aboriginal tongue of “Strine” (Australian), which some say has been
developed through lazy speech habits such as not opening one’s mouth
or moving one’s lips sufficiently. Of course, none of this is true,
and Viv maintains that the following are perfectly understandable
English phrases:

"Oweryerdoon, orrite?" = How are you doing, all right?  
"Egg nishner" = Air conditioner  
"Sayahthis sahvoe" = I'll see you this afternoon  
"Emma Chisit?" = How much is it?  
"Scettin' lairder" = It's getting louder

When she isn’t being misunderstood, Viv likes dancing on the tennis
court, singing cultured classics such as Tswift or the Backstreet Boys
loudly in her room, and conning unfortunate individuals into giving
her massages.
